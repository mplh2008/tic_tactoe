Our test plan was to unit test the different classes and then test the integration between the classes.

First, we ran unit tests on the game class functions to see if they were working. Same for the player class.

Then, we tested out the game class functions that used the Player class along with testing the play_game function which used other game functions that relied on the player class. 

Thankfully, we were able to do so and pass all the tests.
